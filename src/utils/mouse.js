/**
 * A mechanism to rate-limit mouse events so that they don't flood the network
 * channel or generate a long queue of stale events.
 *
 * The current implementation fires mouse events immediately but maintains a
 * timeout window to prevent any low-priority mouse events from firing until the
 * timeout expires. If any low-priority mouse events occur within the timeout
 * window, we save them to fire after the timeout window. We only queue a single
 * event, so we drop all low-priority mouse events during the timeout window
 * except for the final event. We never drop high-priority events - we send them
 * them immediately, discarding any previous timeout window and replacing it
 * with a fresh window.
 *
 * Here is how we classify the types of mouse events:
 *
 *    | Event type | Priority |
 *    |------------|----------|
 *    | Click      | High     |
 *    | Release    | High     |
 *    | Move       | Low      |
 *    | Wheel      | Low      |
 *
 * # Considerations
 *
 *  - Normal mouse movement can generate hundreds of mouse move events in a few
 *      seconds. Sending this many mouse events over the network can clog the
 *      network link or the server's emulated mouse USB interface.
 *  - We want to send mouse events in the same order they occurred to prevent
 *      unexpected behavior on the target system.
 *  - We want to send the first mouse event as quickly as possible to minimize
 *      latency when the user begins moving the mouse.
 *  - We never want to drop the last mouse movement in a sequence because it
 *      determines the mouse's final position. If we drop the final mouse event,
 *      the user might see an offset between their local cursor and their remote
 *      cursor.
 *
 * # Behavior
 *
 * ## Example 1
 *
 * If we have mouse movement events W, X, Y, and Z, here is how the rate-limited
 * mouse will handle them:
 *
 * W[         X   ]
 *                 X[   Y        Z  ]
 *                                   Z
 *
 * The rate limited mouse would process them as follows:
 *
 * - W: Fires immediately because no events are queued.
 * - X: Fires after W's timeout window expires.
 * - Y: Gets queued but never fires because Z bumps it.
 * - Z: Replaces Y in the queue and fires at the end of X's timeout window.
 *
 * ## Example 2
 *
 * If we mouse movement events X, Y, and Z, and a mouse click C, here is how the
 * rate-limited mouse will handle them:
 *
 * X[         C  ]
 *            C[     Y      ]
 *                           Y[   Z        ]
 *                                          Z
 *
 * - X: Fires immediately because no events are queued.
 * - C: Fires immediately because clicks are high-priority. It ends the tiemout
 *      and starts a new one.
 * - Y: Fires at the end of C's timeout window.
 * - Z: Fires at the end of Y's timeout window.
 *
 * # Future improvements
 *
 * There is room for improvement if we wanted to further optimize latency or
 * bandwidth. We could potentially queue more elements and use more
 * optimizations to drop unnecessary events:
 *
 * - We can drop some mouse events with a low probability of affecting the
 *     user's experience. For example, if the mouse moves in the following
 *     sequence:
 *
 *       t=0ms (0, 0)
 *       t=1ms (5, 5)
 *       t=2ms (10, 10)
 *
 *     The mouse event at t=1ms is mostly irrelevant because it doesn't matter
 *     to the user whether the mouse stopped at point (5, 5) on the way to
 *     (10, 10).
 * - Some intermediate mouse events do affect user experience. Consider the
 *     following sequence:
 *
 *       t=0ms   (100, 100)
 *       t=20ms  (500, 100)
 *       t=100ms (100, 100)
 *
 *     The mouse ultimately lands in position (100, 100), but dropping the
 *     event at t=20ms might impact user experience if they meant to send a
 *     right-and-left gesture to the target computer.
 * - The more mouse events we queue for transmission after a rate-limit window,
 *     the more latency the user will perceive because we're creating a backlog
 *     of mouse move events for the browser to process.
